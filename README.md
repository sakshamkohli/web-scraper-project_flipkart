# web-scraper-project_flipkart
This is a web scraper project made using Python and flask 
The basic logic behind the project is simply to extract the required data from any website.
For this particular project, I am extracting customer reviews from Flipkart.
This has a simple user interface where you can add your required item for which you require customer reviews.
